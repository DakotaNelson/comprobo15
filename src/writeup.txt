1. How might rosbag fit into a debugging process as you work on projects in this class?

Rosbag's ability to replay the messages in a system allow for the ROS equivalent of stepping through your code - replicating the state of the system in order to discover what caused various behaviors in the robot.

2. Are there any obvious shortcomings of rosbag as a debugging tool?

File sizes from camera images/video are enormous, and it sounds like it might clobber the network too.

3. Using TF in rviz

Using TF in rviz makes sense - moving the coordinate frame to "map" causes the odom axis to follow the robot as it moves, while keeping the frame in "odom" causes the transform axes to move with the robot.
